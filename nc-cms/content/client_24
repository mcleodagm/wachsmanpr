<h3>Unocoin:&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unocoin, India&rsquo;s leading Bitcoin exchange, joined Wachsman PR just before they conducted the largest raise for an Indian bitcoin company in the country&rsquo;s history. Wachsman PR successfully guided the startup through the announcement and the subsequent media attention, telling the world the story of how a small team from Bangalore raised $1.5 million in a Pre Series-A round, the highest amount for any digital currency venture in the history of India. The narrative caught the eyes of top tier reporters from publications across the world, and over 100 articles appeared following the press release distribution. With Wachsman PR, Unocoin fielded countless media enquiries, phone interviews, email Q&amp;A and commentary opportunities, securing the exchange a reputation as the most recognized and important bitcoin company in India.</p>
<p><br /> <br />During the weeks following the initial announcement, Unocoin received dozens of organic media placements, with media snowballing further, making this one of Wachsman PR&rsquo;s most successful launches. Following the initial release, Unocoin&rsquo;s executives have become highly sought after experts on the potential impact of bitcoin in India, and as participants in discussions ranging from economic debates following Indian demonetization to how banking might be disrupted in the developing world.</p>
