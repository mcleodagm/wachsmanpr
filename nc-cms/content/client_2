<h3>LISK</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lisk is a blockchain application platform that enables its users to build applications from the ground up in JavaScript. The decentralized platform allows for the deployment, distribution and monetization of sidechains onto the Lisk blockchain. Lisk was founded by Max Kordek and Oliver Beddows in 2016, in their stellar crowdsale they attracted over $8M in fundings making them the most successful crowdfunding in Germany history.</p>
<p><br />Lisk came to Wachsman PR for public relations assistance in September 2016, a time when significant technical developments were being completed by the Lisk team. Wachsman PR successfully announced their development milestones to press, while building the reputation of Lisk CEO, Max Kordek by securing expert commentary opportunities on current news topics in mainstream media. In December 2016, Lisk made their biggest announcement to date, the formation of the Lisk Foundation, their not-for-profit arm based in Zug, Switzerland. The launch achieved mass attraction from global top-tier media with Reuters, New York Times, CNBC, Yahoo Finance, and Business Insider all covering the story. Since then, the Lisk team has hired additional developers, launched new and increasingly robust versions of their technology, and announced a partnership with a reputable German design agency. 2017 is looking very bright for Lisk. &nbsp;</p>
