<h3>Coinsource&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coinsource, the world&rsquo;s largest bitcoin ATM network, was founded in late 2014 as a side-project from three co-founders in Texas and California. By the fourth quarter of 2015, Coinsource had three bitcoin ATMs stretched across the United States and hopeful but still limited revenues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coinsource hired Wachsman PR in late 2015 to help enhance demand for their existing machines by jumpstarting exposure to media, beginning with a bitcoin ATM machine in lower Manhattan. Almost immediately, foot traffic to Coinsource&rsquo;s bitcoin ATMs drastically increased, leading to the acquisition of new kiosks to be installed in new territories.</p>
<p><br />Following a persistent public relations strategy, and accelerated by a close partnership together, Coinsource in a little more than one year has become by far the largest bitcoin ATM network in the world. Through a comprehensive, targeted campaign, Coinsource has attracted the attention of trade journalists, high level reporters and broadcasters. Consistent and positive press, through online and print publications, and often on television, Coinsource catapulted ahead of the competition, securing its place alongside the most essential brands in the digital currency world.</p>
