<h3>Chain of Points</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chain of Points is pioneer in the loyalty and rewards industry utilizing a custom blockchain-based solution to empower small and medium sized businesses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toronto-based startup Chain of Points brought Wachsman PR on board in January 2017 to increase awareness around the company&rsquo;s Initial Coin Offering (ICO), enhance the media presence of its founder, Irene Katzela, attract new customers and merchants to the blockchain platform, and promote their novel POINTS system. Beginning with a white paper and through the establishment of a step-by-step press strategy, Wachsman PR defined Chain of Points key characteristics with an eye on differentiation. With a foundation in place, Wachsman PR synthesized on-message content, launching the platform and ICO to securing mainstream, cryptocurrency trade, and retail press interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consequently, Chain of Points received enhanced exposure for their ICO. The WPR team added to this success by publicizing the formation of a high level advisory board, including a former Amazon, Expedia and Microsoft executive, as well as one of the earliest investors in Twitter. Wachsman PR also secured Chain of Points two byline opportunities in the first month of working with Irene, with international consumer focused publications, Women&rsquo;s Wear Daily and Total Retail.</p>
