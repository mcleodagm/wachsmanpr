<h3>iPayYou</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>iPayYou, a Seattle-based company that developed a new bitcoin wallet focused on consumer and commercial applications, brought Wachsman PR on board in April 2016 to launch the product and brand from scratch. Through a structured PR campaign with graduating intensity, the WPR team immediately defined iPayYou as the world&rsquo;s easiest, safest and most useful bitcoin wallet, and developed a foundation for many announcements to come.</p>
<p><br /> Throughout a lasting partnership, Wachsman PR has helped further develop the reputation of iPayYou leadership, determined a strategy for recruiting and attaining wallet consumers, and helped define messaging that fully distinguishes the unique features developed by iPayYou. Today, iPayYou is highly regarded by the cryptocurrency community with thousands of active users. CEO Gene Kavner has become a prominent commentator and advisor for the cryptocurrency industry, a figure bridging the gap between traditional e-commerce and cutting edge technology.</p>
