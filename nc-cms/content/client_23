<p>TaaS, the world&rsquo;s first tokenized closed-end fund dedicated to blockchain investments, hired Wachsman PR in January 2017 at the critical stage of preparing to launch an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). The company needed to communicate how their innovative investment model reduces the risks and technical barriers of investing in the blockchain space while providing ample opportunity for profit generation. Working together with the TaaS team in Europe, Wachsman PR developed a comprehensive strategy to drive investor attention through sustained and substantial media coverage. The result was a company exploding onto the global stage with a series of trade press and several top tier placements that put the company&rsquo;s offering in front of millions of potential investors.</p>
