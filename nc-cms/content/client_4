<h3>KeepKey</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KeepKey, makers of the world&rsquo;s premier hardware wallet, hired Wachsman PR in May 2016 to add substance to a brand that had developed an extraordinary product that had yet to receive commensurate attention from media. The Seattle based startup had built a sleek, simple to use consumer product that could securely protect digital currency and other digital assets. KeepKey CEO Darin Stanchfield had an entrepreneurial and cyber security background, so public relations efforts focused first on his experience and ability to comment on current news topics as a way to instigate buzz. With Wachsman PR&rsquo;s assistance, KeepKey swiftly began receiving recognition, including from a major daily newspaper in New York, a byline article in one of the bestselling business magazines, and with commentary on some of the most highly visible websites, KeepKey&rsquo;s brand presence graduated substantially. Today, KeepKey&rsquo;s international reseller partnerships, peerless product and sterling reputation have resulted in sales so rapid that KeepKey struggles to maintain inventory. Working with Wachsman PR, KeepKey expanded on these successes by appearing on national television and through placement on stories syndicated globally.</p>
