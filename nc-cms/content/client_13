<h3>DECENT</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Swiss-based startup DECENT signed on with Wachsman PR during their Initial Coin Offering in late 2016. Alongside an in-house digital marketing and advertising campaign, DECENT selected Wachsman PR to assist in brand recognition and maintaining investor interest throughout their two month raise. DECENT issued investors with the DCT token, which is designed to incentivize peer to peer content distribution and consumption. Through a series of well timed press releases, expert commentary pitches and ample trade press, Wachsman PR helped generate awareness for the DECENT team and their product, which in effect is akin to a legal torrent streaming service. Consistent, positive exposure saw a spike in investor interest and the DECENT crowdsale concluded with more than $4 million USD raised. Post ICO, DECENT began to expand internationally. They opened up an office in China, brokered several business partnerships, registered a foundation in Switzerland and laid the foundation for a blockchain development hub in Yerevan, Armenia. They closed out a round of deals by bringing in The Hackereum Project in an effort to further heighten platform security. The alliance saw white-hat hackers carry out simulated attacks and pinpoint vulnerabilities to eradicate any software malfunctions and ensure the DECENT protocol remained watertight. &nbsp;</p>
