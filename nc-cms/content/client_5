<h3>IOHK</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IOHK, the world&rsquo;s leading blockchain architects, approached Wachsman PR after two years of operating under the radar researching and developing peer-to-peer technologies to revolutionize financial services. Headquartered in Hong Kong, IOHK partnered with Wachsman PR in January 2017 to launch onto the scene as global leaders in the advanced field of blockchain development, expecting to immediately make their mark. Together with IOHK&rsquo;s leadership, Wachsman PR developed a comprehensive strategy to successfully build IOHK&rsquo;s brand and generate continuous positive perception from media. Wachsman PR was able to successfully introduce IOHK to the world with a bang, securing interviews, byline articles and placements in global Tier 1 and trade press, helping to strengthen the company&rsquo;s reputation of being at the cutting of blockchain innovation. With new research centers opening in every corner, Wachsman PR secured interviews and media placements for IOHK in many of the most influential &nbsp;publications around the world, setting the stage for great things to come.</p>
