<h3>FERMAT</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fermat is a decentralized and blockchain-enabled open source project developing the Internet of People. Fermat&rsquo;s vision is to enable direct device to device communication, independent of any entity or web server. Data will be stored on end user devices and applications will be built to interact with each other directly. This will be enabled via Person-to-Person apps as part of a new technological paradigm, referred to as the Internet of People, an ambitious vision from Founder Luis Molina.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March 2016 Fermat was ready to launch the project to a global audience and selected Wachsman PR as their communications agency to aid them in messaging and media relations. From the outset, Wachsman PR delved into the innovative and exciting concept and provided support to the Fermat senior management team in drafting and editing the whitepaper, defining the core messages for each audience; and developing the press materials to be issued to the media upon launch. By effectively communicating an incredibly complex and largely unexplored concept, Wachsman PR successfully secured launch coverage in top-tier mainstream media, blockchain and cryptocurrency press, immediately enhancing the credibility and achievability of the revolutionary project. One year on, Fermat has made significant progress, adding reputable names to their advisory team, building a global community of over 60 local chapters, and making industry defining developments with its technological advancements.</p>
