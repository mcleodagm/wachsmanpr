<h3>Steemit</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steemit, the world&rsquo;s largest decentralized social media network, hired Wachsman PR a month before their public launch in May 2016. Through the use of an advanced, application-specific blockchain, Steemit found a way to improve social media with revolutionary distributed ledger technology. Bloggers, artists, photographers, reporters could simply upload original content on Steemit.com, and the community would vote on its popularity; the more popular it is, the more digital currency the author could earn. Leveraging a novel concept complicated by a bevy of sophisticated, unprecedented technologies, Wachsman PR helped Steemit receive a consistent stream of influential media placements, receiving globally recognized press online and television appearances nationally and locally. In a matter of months, Steemit grew from an innovative beta with a cult following to one of the fastest-growing social media sites on the internet.</p>
<p><br />Now with a base of over 130,000 registered users, and close to a million unique monthly visitors, with acclaim from wire services, major business publications, and mainstream consumer press, Steemit today is on a similar growth trajectory to the early days of Facebook and Reddit.</p>
