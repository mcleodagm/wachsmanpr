<h2>DAVID WACHSMAN</h2>
<h4>Founder</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>David is the Founder of Wachsman PR.</p>
<p>David began his public relations career in politics, interning in the communications department for Ed Cox, currently Chairman of the New York Republican Party. In 2007, David interned at Linden Alschuler &amp; Kaplan, a traditional Manhattan agency, assisting in the representation of nationally recognized not-for-profits.</p>
<p>David then joined a biotech startup, where he helped develop the business plan, strategy, and brand for a multimillion dollar pharmaceutical company. Subsequently, David worked as technology and branding consultant before becoming CMO at Polin8, a successful mobile app development agency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a second stretch in politics, David worked at advertising giant Ogilvy &amp; Mather before joining Ericho Communications, a boutique public relations agency in Manhattan. At Ericho, David managed dozens of high profile accounts, with clients ranging from a billionaire real estate developer to innovators in manufacturing, from controversial financial services firms to a next generation cosmetics brand, from a publicly-traded consumer app to an international restaurant chain, from a pioneering advertising agency to a major e-commerce services firm, and from a Fifth Avenue museum to Wall Street&rsquo;s bitcoin exchange.</p>
<p>In late 2015, David founded Wachsman PR to provide professional PR services to the rapidly growing but nascent financial technology industry, with bitcoin and blockchain at its foundation. In 2016, Wachsman PR grew from a one-man shop to a ten-employee public relations agency with offices in New York and Dublin. The catalyst to such rapid growth was David&rsquo;s ability to turn complicated, previously undiscovered concepts into digestible content for media and consumers alike. By bridging the gap between blockchain technology and global press, David and his hand selected team became a top industry resource for some of the most reputable publications in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since inception, Wachsman PR has represented more than forty of the most prominent companies in fintech from every corner of the globe.</p>
