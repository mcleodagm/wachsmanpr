<p dir="ltr"><span>Overstock.com's financial services division, t0, created the world's first blockchain-based trading platform to provide investors a better way to buy and sell securities and assets like stocks. Overstock hired Wachsman PR in March 2016 to help proliferate the message of this disruptive technology to cryptocurrency influencers and the wider fintech community, focusing on t0&rsquo;s ability to dramatically improve transparency and settlement times associated with capital market trading. After receiving substantial media attention at Money20/20 Europe conference in April 2016, CEO Patrick Byrne said at the keynote that his trip to Copenhagen was &ldquo;...one of the most productive conferences I have seen...both from the quality of contacts we&rsquo;ve made and from the quality of media here.&rdquo; Afterwards, working together with Overstock.com&rsquo;s internal communications team, Wachsman PR helped form the strategy for important future announcements. Throughout a multi month campaign, Wachsman PR secured placements for t0 in many of the most important print publications and on television in the US and Europe.</span></p>
