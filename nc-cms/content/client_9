<h3><strong>Agentic Group</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Headquartered in New York City, Agentic Group LLC is a global membership-based consortium of Blockchain, Digital Currency and related companies providing education, consulting and development services for businesses, governments and nonprofits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In April 2016, Wachsman PR started working with Agentic Group in order to increase industry awareness of the consortium, enhance the media presence of its Founder, Rik Willard, attract new members, and promote the Group&rsquo;s global events.</p>
<p><br />Over the course of the year, Wachsman PR successfully established industry awareness of the Agentic Group in the US and announced two new Agentic Group offices in Paris and London, introduced global industry leader Ann Camarillo as a board advisor, and positioned Founder Rik Willard as an expert within the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry through consistent, positive media exposure. This led to increased demand for commentary from Rik Willard on the latest industry announcements, continuing to build his impressive list of public engagements globally, and the reputation of Agentic Group LLC worldwide.</p>
