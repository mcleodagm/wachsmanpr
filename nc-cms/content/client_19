<h3>Node40</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Node40 is a blockchain infrastructure and services provider based in Albany, NY. Starting in September 2016, Wachsman PR has helped Node40 establish a brand beyond the Dash cryptocurrency ecosystem, developing an audience and reputation for superior expertise in mainstream media. As the premier provider of masternode hosting solutions for Dash, the world&rsquo;s most rapidly growing cryptocurrency, Node40 hired WPR to educate potential customers and to develop a brand foundation for major developments to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Node40 is a complicated business: with proprietary software and the latest hardware, the company hosts and runs Dash masternodes, special servers that stabilize and run services for the rapidly growing network. In return for their investment, MasterNode owners generate a passive income stream, but only so long as their servers are online and capable of servicing the network. With this in mind, Wachsman PR executed a comprehensive campaign to distill novel concepts into digestible, meaningful content for reporters, and the articles flowed. Node40 was able to achieve terrific media coverage across Q4 2016 and Q1 2017, with both trade and mainstream publications covering the company itself, highlighting expert commentary from CEO Perry Woodin, and with several features in the most important business publications globally.</p>
