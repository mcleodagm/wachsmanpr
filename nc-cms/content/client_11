<p>Founded in 2013, BitGive is the world's first Bitcoin 501c(3) nonprofit organization recognized by the US government. Based in San Francisco, BitGive is spearheading transparency in the philanthropy sector with its latest innovation, GiveTrack, a platform which uses blockchain technology to track and trace each charitable donation. Starting in September 2016, Wachsman PR guided BitGive in successfully unveiling their biggest product feature to date; GiveTrack. To launch the platform, Wachsman PR secured founder Connie Gallippi a platform to speak at an important stage in the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency space, to announce the novel launch. Simultaneously, the announcement generated significant coverage in critical publications including philanthropic press.</p>
