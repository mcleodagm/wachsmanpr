<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Built on Ethereum, Aragon is the first management tool developed specifically to disintermediate the creation and maintenance of companies all around the world. Headquartered in Barcelona, Aragon was co-founded by two recognised tech prodigies, Luis Cuende and Jorge Izquierdo. Cuende has been featured on Forbes&rsquo; 30 Under 30 list, is a MIT TR35, and most recently, co-founded Stampery, a blockchain data certification startup backed by renowned venture capital firm Draper Associates. At the age of 15, Cuende&rsquo;s partner Jorge Izquierdo was awarded a WWDC scholarship by Apple as one of the most promising young app developers. One year later, Izquierdo reached number 2 in the Spanish App Store charts with Showy. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>In April 2017, Wachsman PR started working with Aragon ahead of their month long token sale, in order to increase industry awareness of the platform, enhance the media presence of its Founders and garner the attention of potential investors. As a result Aragon has secured media coverage in top tier press and trade media publications in the lead up to their upcoming token sale.</span></p>
