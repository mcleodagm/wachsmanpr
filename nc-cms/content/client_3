<h3><strong>Dash</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dash, or Digital Cash, is a cryptocurrency considered the superior alternative to bitcoin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Founded in early 2014 under a different name, Dash faced multiple identity and critical branding concerns when they hired Wachsman PR in July 2016. While their technology was groundbreaking, reporters had incorrectly latched onto Dash&rsquo;s ability to enable optional private user transactions, categorizing a payments technology as something controversial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wachsman PR was brought in to provide exposure to Dash&rsquo;s growing record of accomplishment and capacity, educating media and the public on a unique governance system and a self-funded treasury that would finance further development of the coin. After determining a long-term strategy, Wachsman PR was able to dramatically increase the attention paid to organizational developments, technology advancements, and partnership deals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dash&rsquo;s primary selling points became clear in the press; its primary use case is enabling a faster and cheaper decentralized payment corridor, and a currency that improves lives for residents in countries suffering from hyper-inflation, as well as the three billion people worldwide that are unbanked or underbanked. Wachsman PR came on board in July 2016 and the results have been staggering. After significant positive press, well-timed byline placements in Nasdaq.com, expert commentary on industry news and a growing roster of business partnerships, Dash and its team became a household name. In the last 12 months, Dash was the fastest growing cryptocurrency in the world, soaring from a total market capitalisation of $22 million USD to $200 million USD, with trading volumes up 1360%.</p>
