<h3>Jaxx</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Already a well-known name in the cryptocurrency space, CEO Anthony Di Iorio of Jaxx hired Wachsman PR in September 2016 to grow their brand and ensure that their multi-blockchain and multi-platform wallet received attention as it added new features. Wachsman PR initially targeted cryptocurrency publications with several token addition announcements and product announcements, generating a constant torrent of media, before leveraging the background of CEO Anthony Di Iorio, formerly Chief Digital Officer for the Toronto Stock Exchange and a co-founder of Ethereum, to comment on industry news and provide expert commentary to top tier press. When Apple announced which tokens they were going to accept and reject on their iOS devices, Wachsman PR coordinated several interviews for the CEO to ensure a consistent stream of press for Jaxx. Wachsman PR also conducted media escort duties at a major conference and secured dozens of placements in major Canadian and global media.</p>
